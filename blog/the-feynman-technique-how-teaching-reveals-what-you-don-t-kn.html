      <div class="content">
        <p>You're sitting in lecture, nodding along. The professor explains a concept. It makes sense. You highlight the key sentence in your notes. Later, your roommate asks what you learned today.</p>
<p>You open your mouth. Nothing coherent comes out.</p>
<p>This is the illusion of understanding. You recognized the words. You followed the logic while someone else was doing the heavy lifting. But you never built your own working model of the concept. The Feynman Technique exists to shatter that illusion—before an exam does it for you.</p>
<h2>The Method</h2>
<p>Richard Feynman was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist known for his ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms. The technique named after him isn't complicated. It has one rule: explain the concept as if teaching it to someone who knows nothing about it.</p>
<p>Not to a colleague. Not to your professor. To a curious twelve-year-old.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<p>Take a blank piece of paper. Write the concept at the top. Now explain it in plain language, as if the person reading has never encountered this topic before. No jargon. No skipping steps. No "this is obvious" hand-waving.</p>
<p>When you get stuck—when you can't explain something simply, or you realize you're using a term you can't define, or you notice a gap in your logic—you've found exactly what you don't understand. That's not failure. That's the technique working.</p>
<p>Go back to your source material. Fill the gap. Then return to your explanation and try again.</p>
<h2>Why It Works</h2>
<p>Teaching requires a different kind of understanding than recognizing.</p>
<p>When you read a textbook, your brain is in recognition mode. "Yes, I've seen this before. This looks familiar. This makes sense." Recognition feels like understanding, but it's shallow. You're borrowing the author's structure instead of building your own.</p>
<p>When you teach, you have to generate the explanation yourself. You need to know not just what the steps are, but why they come in that order. You need to understand not just the definition, but why that definition matters. You need to see not just the concept, but how it connects to things your student already knows.</p>
<p>Generation is harder than recognition. It requires deeper processing. And that deeper processing is exactly what creates durable understanding.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>Say you're studying cellular respiration. You read that glucose is broken down through glycolysis, then the Krebs cycle, then the electron transport chain. You highlight these terms. You feel like you understand.</p>
<p>Now try the Feynman Technique. Explain cellular respiration to someone who only knows that food gives you energy.</p>
<p>You might start: "So, your cells need energy to do stuff. They get that energy from the food you eat, specifically from glucose, which is a sugar..."</p>
<p>Then you hit a wall. Wait—how does glucose actually become energy? What's the Krebs cycle actually doing? Why are there three separate stages?</p>
<p>Each stumble reveals a gap. You thought you understood cellular respiration because you could recognize the vocabulary. But you couldn't explain why the process works the way it does. You didn't have a model—you had a list of terms.</p>
<p>Now you know exactly what to study.</p>
<h2>The Simplicity Constraint</h2>
<p>The "explain it simply" part isn't optional. It's the whole point.</p>
<p>It's easy to explain something using technical jargon. You can say "glycolysis phosphorylates glucose" and feel like you've explained something. But jargon often hides fuzzy thinking. You're using a complex word as a black box, avoiding the need to understand what's actually inside.</p>
<p>When you force yourself to use simple words, you can't hide. Either you understand what phosphorylation means and can explain it plainly, or you don't and you're stuck. The simplicity constraint is what makes the technique work.</p>
<p>Feynman himself was famous for this. He could explain quantum electrodynamics to undergraduates. Not because he dumbed it down, but because he understood it deeply enough to rebuild it from simple foundations.</p>
<h2>Try This</h2>
<p>Pick one concept from your current studies—something you think you understand. Get a blank sheet of paper. Explain the concept as if teaching it to a smart middle schooler.</p>
<p>Write in complete sentences. No bullet points. No jargon without defining it first.</p>
<p>When you stumble, mark the spot. That's your study guide. Those stumbles aren't signs that you're bad at the subject. They're signs that you found the gaps before your professor did.</p>
<p>Understanding isn't about recognizing familiar words. It's about being able to rebuild ideas from scratch. The Feynman Technique is just a way of testing whether you can actually do that—and showing you exactly where you can't.</p>
