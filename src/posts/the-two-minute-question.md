You're about to read a chapter. Or watch a lecture. Or start a problem set.

Before you do, try this: spend two minutes asking one question.

*What problem is this trying to solve?*

Not "what will be on the test." Not "what are the key terms." What problem—what actual confusion or challenge—did people have before this knowledge existed?

## Why This Works

Every piece of knowledge you're asked to learn was once the answer to a question someone genuinely wanted to solve. "The heart has four chambers" is a dead fact. "Why wouldn't two chambers work?" is alive.

One is something to memorize. The other is something to figure out.

When you find the question behind the fact, your brain shifts from passive absorption to active problem-solving. You're not trying to remember arbitrary information anymore. You're trying to understand why things are the way they are.

## The Two-Minute Version

Before your next study session:

1. Look at the topic you're about to learn
2. Ask: "What were people confused about before this existed?"
3. Write down your best guess
4. Study with that question in mind

You don't need the "right" question. Any genuine question creates a gap your brain wants to close. That gap is curiosity. And curiosity is the difference between information that sticks and information that vanishes.
