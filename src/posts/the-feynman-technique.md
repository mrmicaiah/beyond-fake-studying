You're sitting in lecture, nodding along. The professor explains a concept. It makes sense. You highlight the key sentence in your notes. Later, your roommate asks what you learned today.

You open your mouth. Nothing coherent comes out.

This is the illusion of understanding. You recognized the words. You followed the logic while someone else was doing the heavy lifting. But you never built your own working model of the concept. The Feynman Technique exists to shatter that illusion—before an exam does it for you.

## The Method

Richard Feynman was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist known for his ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms. The technique named after him isn't complicated. It has one rule: explain the concept as if teaching it to someone who knows nothing about it.

Not to a colleague. Not to your professor. To a curious twelve-year-old.

Here's how it works:

Take a blank piece of paper. Write the concept at the top. Now explain it in plain language, as if the person reading has never encountered this topic before. No jargon. No skipping steps. No "this is obvious" hand-waving.

When you get stuck—when you can't explain something simply, or you realize you're using a term you can't define, or you notice a gap in your logic—you've found exactly what you don't understand. That's not failure. That's the technique working.

Go back to your source material. Fill the gap. Then return to your explanation and try again.

## Why It Works

Teaching requires a different kind of understanding than recognizing.

When you read a textbook, your brain is in recognition mode. "Yes, I've seen this before. This looks familiar. This makes sense." Recognition feels like understanding, but it's shallow. You're borrowing the author's structure instead of building your own.

When you teach, you have to generate the explanation yourself. You need to know not just what the steps are, but why they come in that order. You need to understand not just the definition, but why that definition matters.

This generation process is where real learning happens. It forces you to organize information into a coherent structure. It exposes the gaps you didn't know you had. It transforms passive familiarity into active understanding.

## The Simplicity Test

There's a reason Feynman emphasized explaining to a child: jargon is a crutch.

When you use technical terms, you can hide confusion behind them. "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell" sounds like understanding, but it's just a memorized phrase. Can you explain what a powerhouse actually does? Can you explain why cells need one?

Simple language forces honesty. If you can't explain something without jargon, you don't really understand it—you've just memorized a translation.

The goal isn't to dumb things down. The goal is to prove you understand deeply enough to rebuild the concept from first principles.

## How to Actually Use This

Here's a practical approach:

1. Pick one concept from your current studying
2. Get a blank piece of paper or open a new document
3. Write the concept at the top
4. Explain it as if teaching someone who's never heard of it
5. When you get stuck or use jargon you can't define, mark it
6. Go back to your materials and figure out that specific piece
7. Return to your explanation and continue

Don't just do this in your head. Write it out. Speaking works too—some people literally explain concepts out loud to an empty room or a rubber duck on their desk. The point is to force yourself to produce words, not just consume them.

## The Rubber Duck Effect

Programmers have a technique called rubber duck debugging. When their code doesn't work, they explain it line by line to a rubber duck on their desk. More often than not, the act of explaining reveals the bug.

The Feynman Technique is rubber duck debugging for understanding. You don't need an actual audience. You just need to produce an explanation rather than consume one.

The duck never says anything useful. The magic is entirely in the explaining.

## When to Use It

The Feynman Technique works best for:

- Concepts that seem simple but feel fuzzy
- Material you've read multiple times but can't recall
- Topics where you can follow along but couldn't reproduce the logic
- Anything you'd struggle to explain to a friend

It's particularly powerful for subjects with layered concepts, where understanding A requires understanding B, which requires understanding C. If you can't explain C simply, you'll never really grasp A.

## The Discomfort Is the Point

The Feynman Technique is uncomfortable. You will discover gaps. You will realize that concepts you thought you understood were just familiar sounds. You will feel dumb.

This is exactly why it works. The discomfort is information. Every gap you discover now is a gap that won't surprise you on exam day.

Most study techniques help you feel productive. The Feynman Technique helps you actually learn. The difference is whether you're optimizing for comfort or for understanding.

*The Feynman Technique is one example of what we call "Teach It"—techniques that use explanation to deepen understanding. The core insight is simple: if you can't teach it, you don't know it.*
