## What is Beyond Fake Studying?

Beyond Fake Studying is about learning how to actually learn. Not the grinding, highlighting, re-reading kind of studying that feels productive but doesn't stick. The kind that works with your brain instead of against it.

Most study advice tells you to try harder. This site tells you to try smarter.

## The Problem

You've probably experienced this: you spend hours with your textbook, you highlight the important parts, you feel like you're making progress. Then the test comes and... nothing. The information you thought you knew has vanished.

This isn't a you problem. It's a method problem.

The techniques most students use—re-reading, highlighting, cramming—feel like learning but don't actually create lasting memory. They're fake studying. They check the "I studied" box without building real understanding.

## The Solution

There's a better way. Cognitive science has identified techniques that genuinely work: spaced repetition, active recall, elaborative interrogation, the Feynman technique, and more.

These methods aren't secrets. They're just not taught.

Beyond Fake Studying exists to change that. Every post here is about replacing ineffective habits with evidence-based techniques that stick.
